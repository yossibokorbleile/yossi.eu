My focus in research is applying tools from (algebraic) geometry and (algebraic) topology to data analysis. In particular, I work with researchers in biology, biophysics, chemistry and medicine to investigate and understand how the shape of data allows us to gain insights into complex biological/physical/chemical processes. Of particular interest is how the shape of objects relates to their physical properties.

As part of this, I produce code packages to help researchers independently leverage these geometric and topological tools in their research. For more information about these packages, see [Software](/software/).

At Aalborg University, I was part of the project *Deciphering Nanoporosity of Amorphous Materials using Topological Data Analysis*.
